# CLUSTERING-AND-DIMENSONALITY-REDUCTION-ALGORITHM
This project is about the implementation of two clustering algorithms namely, 1. K-means 2. Expectation Maximization And the following feature dimensionality reduction algorithms 1. Any one feature selection algorithm (decision tree, forward selection, backward elimination, etc.) 2. PCA 3. ICA 4. Randomized Projections on  SGEMM GPU kernel performance Data Set . In this report the goal is to find the patterns using the dataset and understand the patterns. Keras library is used (TensorFlow Backend) for implementing Neural Network.
